          <p className={classes.aboutText}>
              {nounsDaoLink} has proven to be a strong mechanism for continuous funding alongside a simple, yet effective governance framework. Public Goods are necessary, often detached from value capture out of necessity, and notoriously difficult to fund. Thus, we have forked Nouns and replaced all heads with memetic representations of public goods, as an experiment in continuous public goods funding. All ETH from Public Noun auctions goes direct to Public Nouns DAO, where one Public Noun equals one vote. Public Nouns DAO members curate and fund public goods projects. 
          </p>
          <p>The mission of Public Nouns DAO is to support public goods by:</p>
          <p>
          <ol>
            <li>experimenting with new methods of public goods funding, starting with Public Nouns itself.</li>
            <li>spreading awareness of public goods</li>
            <li>funding public goods, creators, and public goods mechanisms</li>

               Public Nouns DAO utilizes a fork of {compoundGovLink} and is the main governing body of the
               Public Nouns ecosystem. The Public Nouns DAO treasury receives 100% of ETH proceeds from daily
               Public Noun auctions. Each Public Noun is an irrevocable member of Public Nouns DAO and entitled to one
                vote in all governance matters. Public Noun votes are non-transferable (if you sell your
                pNoun the vote goes with it) but delegatable, which means you can assign your vote to
                someone else as long as you own your Public Noun.

              Governance ‘Slow Start’

              <p>
              Since 1 Public Noun equals 1 vote in Public Nouns DAO, this creates a continuous risk of 51% attack. To help safeguard the treasury, the founders of Nouns (nounders) started governance with the ability to veto proposals.
              </p>
              <p>
                From Nouns DAO:<br />
                <i>
                  The proposal veto right was initially envisioned as a temporary solution to the
                  problem of ‘51% attacks’ on the Nouns DAO treasury. While pNounders initially
                  believed that a healthy distribution of Nouns would be sufficient protection for
                  the DAO, a more complete understanding of the incentives and risks has led to
                  general consensus within the pNounders and the wider
                  community that a more robust game-theoretic solution should be implemented before
                  the right is removed.
                </i>
              </p>
              <p>
                <i>
                  Consequently, the pNounders anticipates being the steward of the veto power
                  until Public Nouns DAO is ready to implement an alternative, and therefore wishes to
                  clarify the conditions under which it would exercise this power.
                </i>
              </p>
              <p>
                <i>
                  The pNounders considers the veto an emergency power that should not be
                  exercised in the normal course of business. The pNounders will veto
                  proposals that introduce non-trivial legal or existential risks to the Public Nouns DAO
                  or the pNounders, including (but not necessarily limited to) proposals
                  that:
                  </i>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><i>unequally withdraw the treasury for personal gain</i></li>
                <li><i>bribe voters to facilitate withdraws of the treasury for personal gain</i></li>
                <li><i>
                  attempt to alter Public Noun auction cadence for the purpose of maintaining or acquiring
                  a voting majority</i>
                </li>
                <li><i>make upgrades to critical smart contracts without undergoing an audit</i></li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                <i>
                  There are unfortunately no algorithmic solutions for making these determinations
                  in advance (if there were, the veto would not be required), and proposals must be
                  considered on a case by case basis.
                </i>
              </p>
              <p>
                In the case of Public Nouns, here is a bit more on how the pNounders intend to utilize, and eventually rescind their veto rights. 
              </p>
              <p>
                We plan on only using the veto on:<br />
                <li>malicious proposals, such as those described above by NounsDAO</li>
                <li>proposals grossly misaligned with the manifesto of Public Nouns DAO</li>
                <li>Public Nouns DAO manages the manifesto, and can thus update its intent.</li>
              </p>
              <p>Even with a healthy distribution of Public Nouns, this cannot be assured forever, so a 51% attack will always be possible with the current setup of power (Public Nouns) that can be acquired with capital. Our hope is to work with Public Nouns DAO on an acceptable solution amongst the tradeoffs, and when they feel it is safe to rescind our voting power. Thus, we currently plan on rescinding the veto power when a viable alternative emerges to prevent 51% attack as described above by NounsDAO. Due to our intent of supporting public goods, the pNounders veto may remain desired to help ensure mission delivery. Ultimately, the veto should be removed if there is clear signal from Public Nouns DAO that it is no longer needed to ensure mission.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, pNounders is not closed off to new membership. As Public Nouns DAO votes in new community/art pairs, the communities should receive a delegate in pNounders group to help steward governance.</p>

              <p>
                  Public Nouns are stored directly on Ethereum and do not utilize pointers to other
                  networks such as IPFS. This is possible because Public Noun parts are compressed and
                  stored on-chain using a custom run-length encoding (RLE), which is a form of
                  lossless compression. 
              </p>
              <p>
                  The compressed parts are efficiently converted into a single base64 encoded SVG
                  image on-chain. To accomplish this, each part is decoded into an intermediate
                  format before being converted into a series of SVG rects using batched, on-chain
                  string concatenation. Once the entire SVG has been generated, it is base64
                  encoded.

              <p>
                  The Public Noun Seeder contract is used to determine Noun traits during the minting
                  process. The seeder contract can be replaced to allow for future trait generation
                  algorithm upgrades. Additionally, it can be locked by the Nouns DAO to prevent any
                  future updates. Currently, Noun traits are determined using pseudo-random number
                  generation:
              </p>
              <code>keccak256(abi.encodePacked(blockhash(block.number - 1), nounId))</code>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p>
                  Trait generation is not truly random. Traits can be predicted when minting a Noun
                  on the pending block.

                  Every 30th Public Noun for the first year of the project (Public Noun ids #10, #40, #70, and so on) will be automatically sent to the

                  Every 30th Public Noun for the first year of the project (Public Noun ids #20, #50, #80, and so on) will be automatically sent to the

                  These distributions don't interfere with the cadence of the 12 hour auctions. Public Nouns
                  are sent directly to the recipient, and auctions continue on schedule
                  with the next available Public Noun ID.
